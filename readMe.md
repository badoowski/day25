How the Excercise was achieved:

    1. A little bit of HTML and CSS was used to structure and design the interface.
    2. Javascript DOM was used to give the interface some functionality like assigning function to the button like telling it what to do when been clicked.
    3. The 'indexx.html' file is the exercise we were asked to do.
    4. The 'index.html' file is the method i tried by using a chart from 'Apexchart'
